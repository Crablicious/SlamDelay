# SlamDelay

SlamDelay is a simple addon to track statistics when slamming in Classic TBC.

Statistic explanation:

- Delay: Delay in milliseconds of the last slam.
- Avg: Average delay of slams.
- Min: Minimum delay of slams.
- Max: Maximum delay of slams.
- Early: Amount of too early slams. An early slam is defined as a delay > 3.
- Ratio: Ratio of Slam/Melee attacks

The red button clears the statistics.

No configuration is available as of now apart from making the change yourself in the source.
